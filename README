GNU recutils'es recfile parser/writer on pure Go.
recfiles are human-editable, plaintext databases. This library allows
you to read records and their fields from it. Look for cmd/gorecsel as
an example usage.

* iterate through the records and their fields
* ignore comments
* support continuation lines (\$) and multilines (^+)

Limitations:
* leading spaces in the first line of the value are ignored
* trailing backslash at the end of lines is followed by space

Also there is go.cypherpunks.ru/recfile/slog.NewRecfileHandler log/slog
handler to write your logs in recfile format directly.

It is free software: see the file COPYING for copying conditions.
